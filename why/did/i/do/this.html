        <h1>Hi again.</h1>

<!-- This is my semi-public statement about the future of me, my name, this site, and everything else.<br>
To start this off, the reason I took the site down is due to there not being a point in keeping it updated and shit like that.<br>
The reason I'm quitting the name “AddEdit” aka “Edit” aka “AddEditt” is due to real life, my dox (I can confirm all the info on that dox (https://doxbin.net/upload/AddEditDox) <br>
 is real and has been made by me due to not just my me nuking sum kids discord and leaking a cheat, but also due to my involvement in 9b9t, 2b2t, 5b5t and a few other Minecraft <br>
 servers and groups), and also my mental health. Another reason I'm quitting this bullshit is my irl “friends” that have known me under this name for a while now. (I don't have any irl friends anymore due to everyone being a fucking ass hole and a backstabbing dumb fucks.)
